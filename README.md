# Unity Blog Backup: Jan 16, 2019
In Unity's own blog, in a post titled "Updated Terms of Service and commitment to being an open platform", they state:
>**Retroactive TOS changes**
>When you obtain a version of Unity, and donâ€™t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.

This repo is a saved copy of that blog post, kept in the event that Unity deletes that blog post, as evidence of that promise they made to developers.
